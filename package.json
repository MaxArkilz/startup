  "description": "Creating healthy meal plans for a month or two can be a difficult task. Sometimes its hard to think of all the recipes you know and create a shopping list accordingly. What if there was an intuitive program where you and your family could plan together and then a shopping list was automatically created. Something like this could help you to eat healthier, get everyone excited about meals throughout the month, and make the shopping experience much quicker.",
