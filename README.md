# Food Planner Assistant Application
## Elevator Pitch
Creating healthy meal plans for a month or two can be a difficult task. Sometimes its hard to think of all the recipes you know and create a shopping list accordingly. What if there was an intuitive program where you and your family could plan together and then a shopping list was automatically created. Something like this could help you to eat healthier, get everyone excited about meals throughout the month, and make the shopping experience much quicker. 

## Design
The program would have three tabs: Meal plan, Cookbook, and Shopping. The meal plan page would provide an interactive experience where people could share their meal calendar with others who could drag and drop recipes to days in the month in real time.

A second page would display a shopping list generated from a meal plan and allow 1-4 shoppers to check items off as they split up in the store to make shopping faster.
